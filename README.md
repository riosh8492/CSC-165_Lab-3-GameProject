#Instructions for compiling/running program.
1. Run the compile.bat file. This file compiles key classes within the project. Before running the actual
   Game, run the Networking_run.bat to set up the Game server to receive messages from the client. Once
   the server is running proceed to step 2. 
   
2. For client creation, it is important to use only the Multiplayer option for now when prompted. For the 
   IP address and port number, be sure that they are the same as the game servers. This ensures connection
   for when starting up the client. There are two run.bat files. Choose the simple bat file to be able to 
   manually enter IP address and Port number.
