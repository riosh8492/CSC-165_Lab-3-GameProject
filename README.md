#Instructions for running Networking Portion of Milestone 1.
1. Compile the Networking compile.bat and run.bat files. Ensure Port Number is consistent.
   I would say to run the Networking Main file in your IDE. Then create clients via different command windows.
   
2. For client creation, I included two different run.bat files with different run commands. 
   The commands only differ in their IP address. I got it to work by getting my computer's IPv4 address 
   in one client run command and then in the second client run command used the local host address; 127.0.0.1
   Results may vary, but it worked for me. I'll try to use the computers labs to test it more.
