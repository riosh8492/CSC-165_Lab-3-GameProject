# Instructions for compiling/running program. Final Note.
1. Run the compile.bat file. This file compiles key classes within the project. 

2. Before running the actual Game: run the networking_run.bat to set up the Game server to 
   allow for NPC single player gameplay, and allow for multiplayer Networking gameplay. 
   
3. For client creation: 
   Run the run.bat file. This will start a client program that connects to the server. Of course, 
   the program will ask the user for input for the IP address and Port Number used by the Server.
   Once that is given, the program will ask if you prefer to play in full screen or windowed mode. 
   Once that is given, the game will begin.
   
4. For Network gameplay:
   Follow the steps in Step 3 to create a second client to connect to the server.
